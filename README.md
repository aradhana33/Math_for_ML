Math for Machine Learning ðŸš€

Overview

Welcome to Math for Machine Learning â€“ a personal repository where I document my journey through essential mathematical concepts required to master machine learning. This repository is designed as a structured collection of notes, computations, and practical exercises covering fundamental areas like:

Linear Algebra â€“ Vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, and applications

Calculus â€“ Differentiation, integration, and optimization

Statistical Analysis â€“ Probability, distributions, hypothesis testing

Convex Optimization â€“ Gradient descent, Lagrange multipliers, and constrained optimization

Algorithms â€“ Mathematical foundations of key algorithms

These topics form the core mathematical foundation necessary for advanced studies in machine learning, deep learning, and data science.

Why This Repository?

This project is a personal endeavor to solidify my understanding of complex mathematical topics by documenting notes, solving problems, and sharing useful insights. It serves as a reference for me and potentially for others interested in machine learning mathematics.

Contributing

As this is a personal learning repository, contributions are not currently being accepted. However, feedback, corrections, and discussions are welcome through the Issues tab.
